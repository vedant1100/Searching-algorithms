Linear-search-algorithm is a searching algorithm which searches required elements in a data structure linearly .i.e. one at a single time in a straight order.
Worst time complexity: O(n)
Best time complexity: O(1)
Binary search algorithm is a searching algorithm which searches required elements in a data structure by dividing it into two equal parts
Time complexity: O(logn)
Best time complexity: O(1)
